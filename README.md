# Cardiovascular Disease Risk Prediction with Machine Learning
This project applies Machine Learning (ML) to predict cardiovascular disease risk, following the CRISP-DM methodology. Using a public health dataset, we performed data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation.

We experimented with supervised algorithms (Decision Trees, Multi-layer Perceptron, k-NN) and unsupervised techniques (k-Means, DBSCAN) to identify key risk patterns. The Decision Tree model achieved 87% accuracy, demonstrating the power of ML in healthcare.

This study highlights the importance of AI in predictive analytics, offering insights for early diagnosis and preventive healthcare strategies. Future improvements could integrate biometric data and real-time decision support systems.
